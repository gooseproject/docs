GoOSe Project Documentation
===========================

GoOSe documentation is written in reStructuredText[1]. RST was chossen because of the GoOSE project use of github, which provied exellent support for rst. In order to make friendly documentation we are using sphinx[2] to create HTML, and PDF documentation. The goal of GoOSe documentation is not to create docs for GoOSe alone but to provide documentaion for anyone who is looking to take on the task of createing an enterprise Linux rebuild.

All documentation in this repo is CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted.
