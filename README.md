GoOSe Project Documentation
===========================

GoOSe documentation is written in [reStructuredText][1]. RST was chosen because of the GoOSE project use of github, which provide excellent support for rst. In order to make friendly documentation we are using [sphinx][2] to create HTML, and PDF documentation. The goal of GoOSe documentation is not to create docs for GoOSe alone but to provide documentation for anyone who is looking to take on the task of creating an enterprise Linux rebuild.

All documentation in this repo is CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted.
